# Breast-Cancer-Detection-using-Neural-networks
This project demonstrates a breast cancer detection model built using a neural network. It utilizes the Breast Cancer dataset available from sklearn.datasets and implements the model using TensorFlow and Keras. The main objective is to achieve high accuracy in predicting whether a tumor is malignant or benign based on input features.
