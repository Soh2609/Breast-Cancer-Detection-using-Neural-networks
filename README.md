# Breast-Cancer-Detection-using-Neural-networks
This project demonstrates a breast cancer detection model built using a neural network. It utilizes the Breast Cancer dataset available from sklearn.datasets and implements the model using TensorFlow and Keras. The main objective is to achieve high accuracy in predicting whether a tumor is malignant or benign based on input features.

Features
Dataset: The Breast Cancer dataset from sklearn.datasets.
Technology Stack: Python, TensorFlow, and Keras.
Model Performance: Achieves an impressive accuracy of 97.70%.
Objective: Provide a reliable machine learning model for early breast cancer detection.
